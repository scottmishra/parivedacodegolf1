# Pariveda Code Golf Competition \#1
###Problem to Solve
Since we're trying this out for the first time, I tried to pick a relatively simple problem. This might end up being too easy for some participants. I had a good suggestion to make the language one that fins don't use a lot so this first one will be in Python 2 (unless there's a lot of complaining)
The problem to solve is a wordsearch problem. I have some code to get you started. Your job is to write an algorithm that will search through the wordsearch puzzle, picking out each word's coordinates within the puzzle. I have the expected output in the code under test.py. Words can go forwards or backwards, up or down, or diagonal in all directions (and they in fact do).
Once your code is done, submit it to me through email. I'll run it through another crossword puzzle with same dimensions (50x50) and similar word patterns.
### Rules
Rules are pretty loosey-goosey right now. Feel free to get help, work as teams, google stuff, etc. Even feel free to straight copy-paste someone else's solution from the internet. The purpose of this is to stretch your problem-solving capacity and maybe learn a thing or two about Python.
Importing libraries is allowed however, every line of code in that library will be included under the brevity category of judging (see below).
### Judging Criteria
Code will first be ran to see if it accomplishes the task, in this case, it has to pick out the coordinates of each word in the right order. All passing code will be judged on the following three criteria:
* Brevity, not including comments (hence code golf)
* Efficiency
* Readability
The last category is subjective and I will be getting help for that. The other two categories can be easily determined and shown.
Also, please note that I won't post or email anyone's code without asking permission. No need to worry about public embarrasment.
